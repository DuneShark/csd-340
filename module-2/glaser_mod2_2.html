        <h2>Chapter 1: Tanner Glaser, A Life Story</h2>

        <p class="intro">I grew up in a functional dysfunctional family. My parents were divorced when I was 4 years
            old. Although they dislike each other, they both love me.</p>
        <p>My family has grown very large. <span class="sentence">I am two sisters, a step-sister, two step-brothers,
            and a half-brother.</span> My family can have drama but we all love each other. </p>
        <p>I have gone on a lot of adventures with my family. We have travled all over the country and even outside
            the country. I have lots of wonderful memories from those trips. </p>
