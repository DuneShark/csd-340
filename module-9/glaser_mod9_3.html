        <h2>"Do not go gentle into that good night" by Dylan Thomas</h2>

        <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        <p>Though <span id="wise">____</span> men at their end know dark is right,<br>Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
        <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>Their <span id="frail">_____</span> deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in <span id="flight">______</span>,<br>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
        <p>Grave men, near <span id="death">_____</span>, who see with blinding sight<br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
